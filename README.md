# NetworkingForIntroverts
Tired of being asked for your twitter handle? Well now you can!

Do you spend a lot of time on twitter? Are you the internet argumentative sort? Are you paranoid?

Well now you can have the best of both worlds.

Set up a twitter account, add your keys, and then run some of these!

## Files
#oAuth.example.py
drop those keys in here and rename!

# BasicAccount.py
delete all your tweets, unfollow everyone and force everyone to unfollow you!

Sounds like you had a good day!

And when you eventually come back (we sure missed you) use the frequency functions to get yourself started in an area of interest!

# FollowSpider.py
Look who someone else is following, and who they're following. Gotta keep up!

Even puts it in a nice graph for you (using the convenient Networkx library).

Eventually, maybe you can use that information to follow some more people (but that's not implemented here).

Networking is fun!

# main.py
A convenient entry point!

# StreamingStuff.py
 Nothing to see here
